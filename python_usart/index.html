		<h2>Short introduction to my project</h2>
		<p>This project represents a simulation of a Smart House system.
			It is made using an Atmega32 uC on an EvB 5.1 Kit, some sensors
			and a little embedded C, Python and HTML scripting. The house 
			uses sensors to do some actions in background when some events 
			are taking place and it can perform some user actions.</p>
		<p>The sensors that I have used are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>DS18B20 - temperature sensor</li>
			<li>MQ-2 - gas sensor</li>
			<li>HC-SR501 - proximity sensor</li>
			<li>TSOP4836 - IR receiver</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Other equipment:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>LCD display</li>
			<li>L298N driver and DC motor</li>
			<li>green LED for the light</li>
			<li>IR remote control</li>
			<li>Buzzer</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Project main utilities</h2>
		<p>The house has 2 states. The house is locked 
			by default and it askes for a password PIN to unlock.
			In background it has some security checks for the 
			temperature and gas leaks. The proximity sensor is 
			activated only in locked state. If any gas leak or high 
			temperature is detected, the fan starts and a message is 
			displayed on the LCD and the buzzer starts.</p>
		<p>After unlock there are a few menus to manually control 
			the house: temperature display, AC control menu and 
			light menu.</p>
		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>I have started by coding in C the main drivers for the sensors 
			and peripherals.</p>
		<img src="images/drivers.jpg" style="width:35%;margin-left:5%;"></img>
		<p>After I have finished the drivers, I have started the final project 
			This was the time to find if all the work was not wasted.</p>
		<p>It took about a week to finish the main projects and it looked ok.
			But that was not all...</p>
		<h2>Taking the project to the next level</h2>
		<p>Because I ran out of ideas, I said why not implement the remote 
			control inside an application. So, I did it.</p>
		<img src="images/remote.jpg" style="width:35%;margin-left:5%;"></img>
		<p>So, now the house could be controlled with the remote control 
			and with the application with USART protocol sending and recieving 
			data to/from the board.</p>
		<p>And, of course, this was not enough...And because of that, I had 
			the idea to implement a website to show the live temperature of the 
			house and, why not, present my project to you using this site :)</p>
